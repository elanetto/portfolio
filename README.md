## Description

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills as a FrontEnd Developer for the job market.
This site showcases these projects:

- [Wedding Website](https://github.com/elanetto/wedding)
- [Game Hub](https://github.com/elanetto/game-hub)
- [Science Museum](https://github.com/elanetto/science-museum)
- [Escape the Classroom](https://github.com/elanetto/elanetto.github.io/tree/main)

## Tools and technology
My portfolio is built with HTML and CSS, and it was first designed and planned in Figma.

## Figma
Check out my Figma-file [here](https://www.figma.com/design/vBWtxr0SAQVuYMFrWea3Uw/portfolio-site?node-id=44-96&t=ndQsyqWru8d5nmZG-1)

## What was the assignment?
We were given a brief from Noroff about creating our own portfolio website. 

- The target audience is possible employers
- Showcase at least 3 projects
- Write ReadMe-files for the projects
- Presenting our finished project for the class

## How was the process?
I was eager to start, and started with Figma. I wanted to use colours and illustrations, as well as images and anecdotes.
My site is created entiraly in HTML and CSS, and I have been editing small details again and again to make ut just right.

## Learning Points & self assesment
I have learned a lot. Something so simple as to set a background-image in CSS to a div, and then have a div with a text-box within that div, to create a floating-over-image effect with the text. I used to do this with position: absolute; earlier. Using position: absolute always ruined the rest of the layout, and as I love using Flex, this simple way of getting the results I wanted blew my mind!

```bash
.hero {
background-image: url("assets/images/hero/anette_hero_small.jpeg");
}

.over-hero {
    color: var(--white);
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.75rem black);
}
```

What can be done better? Well, I used CSS to create the dropdown-menu of this site, but I could have used JavaScript. I could also add more hover-effects to the portfolio-cards and other clickable links.
