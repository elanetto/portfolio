A collection of some of my FrontEnd Dev projects.

## Description

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills as a FrontEnd Developer for the job market.
This site showcases these projects:

- [Wedding Website](https://github.com/elanetto/wedding)
- [Game Hub](https://github.com/elanetto/game-hub)
- [Science Museum](https://github.com/elanetto/science-museum)
- [Escape the Classroom](https://github.com/elanetto/elanetto.github.io/tree/main)

## Tools and technology
My portfolio is built with HTML and CSS, and it was first designed and planned in Figma.

## Figma

## What was the assignment?
We were given a brief from Noroff about creating our own portfolio website. The target audience is possible employers, and we were to choose at least three projects to showcase.
One part of the project was also to create and write ReadMe-files for the projects, as well as presenting our finished project for the class.

## How was the process?
I was eager to start, and started with Figma. I wanted to use colours and illustrations, as well as images and anecdotes.
My site is created entiraly in HTML and CSS, and I have been editing small details again and again to make ut just right.

## Learning Points & self assesment
I have learned a lot. Something so simple as to set a background-image in CSS to a div, and then have a div with a text-box within that div, to create a floating-over-image effect with the text. I used to do this with position: absolute; earlier. My understanding of coding and design is getting better by the day.

I still need to learn how to use JavaScript better. I used CSS to create the dropdown-menu of this site, but I should have used JavaScript.
I have been bed-ridden because of a back-injury for several months, so I am far behind my class. But I am eager to be back in the game!
